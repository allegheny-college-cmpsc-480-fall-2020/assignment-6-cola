## Overview
 
Now that you have the job comes the potentially harder part: actually living. Depending on a number of factors, the costs of living can vary pretty widely, though there are general percentage guidelines for the limits of items categorized as "living expenses." Location factors heavily into which side of the scale expenses fall. Personal finance experts tout a `50`/`30`/`20` plan in which:

* 50% of income should be dedicated to necessites
* 30% of income goes to things classified as "wants"
  * This also include irregular, "big-ticket" items in some versions of the plan
* 20% -- ideally -- should go to a savings or retirement plan

How we actually spend our money on "essential items" is a bit different:

|Category |Average spend|
|---------|-------------|
|Housing  |25 - 35%     |
|Transport|10 - 17%     |
|Healthcare|7 - 10%     |
|Food     |12 - 17%     |
|Education|2 - 5%       |

As you can see, this is a delicate balancing act -- one that you may have to do soon. For those of you for whom this is a few years away, it's never too early to get a head start.

### Requirements

For this assignment, each group will be assigned a city to profile in a presentation for the class given on 21 October. Your group's city will be posted in your group's Slack channel along with resources for the assignment.

#### Presentation

Your goal is to:

* Identify a reasonable average salary for a Software Engineer in your given location
  * Have the number? Great. You don't get all of it: [remove an estimate of payroll tax](https://www.calculator.net/take-home-pay-calculator.html)
    * Set `Pay frequency` to `Monthly`
      * Some of you may experience bi-weekly, but many places only pay 1 time a month
    * Assess your state income tax, assess city tax if you can find it -- some cities are a bit cagey
    * Reserve 10% in the `Pretax deductions withheld` category; adjust down to 5% if needed
    * Take out 2% in the `Deductions not withheld` category (most folks have _some_ student loans)
* From resources provided, determine a monthly budget based on:
  * Median rent
    * Where possible, include utilities in this calculation
  * Average cost of groceries
  * Average transportation costs
    * This is either:
      * A car payment (look up averages) and gas or,
      * Look up public transit costs
* Determine:
  * A realistic monthly budget
  * A list of neighborhoods that might be good choices (max. 3)
    * Plus, give us a little bit about them
  * How feasible it is to live in this city
    * This may require coming to the conclusion that there is a nearby community which is a best-fit compromise
* Compare some of these costs against either those in Meadville or your collective home region(s)
* Describe what was surprising or challenging about the data you found

Keep in mind: 

* an _optimal_ budget fits in the `50`/`30`/`20` model. 
* a _reasonable_ budget falls within the percentages above

#### Reflection

In the `reflection.md` file in the `writing` folder, respond to the various questions. Some of these may be the same as others included in your presentations.

### Grading criteria

Like many assignments in this course, assessment of this work is based on completeness. I may indicate that you should revise this assignment which is an opporunity to receive full credit for the assignment should there be missing points or content.

Also note that this is a _group_ assignment. I keep metrics of how folks think about their group's contribution and am able to draw general conclusions about group participation. That written: contribute meaningfully.
